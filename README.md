This is the website for my selected portfolio project.

For the website, I used a template designed by HTML5 UP. 
Jekyll integration was created by Andrew Banchich.

# Additional features
For some elements on the website, I used a style designed by me.
It fixes some problems with the basic template.

I changed some layout elements, but they were minor changes.

# Why Jekyl? Why this template?
I chose Jekyll for my blog because I want to learn how to use it. I want to learn how to configure existing remote Jekyll templates from repositories maintained by others.
