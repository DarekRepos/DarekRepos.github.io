This is Website for my selected portfolio project

For website i used template designed by HTML5 UP and
Jekyll integration was created by Andrew Banchich

# aditional features
For some elements on the website i used style designed by me
It fix some problems with the basic template

I changed some layout elements but it was minor changes

# WHY Jekyl? Why this template?
I chose Jekyll for blog because i want to learn how to use it. i want learn to configure existing jekylls template from repositorys maintained by others.
